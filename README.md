#Anet

Anet is the network of twenty academic libraries in the Antwerp and Limburg regions. All of these libraries use Anet's Brocade Library Services (Brocade for short) as their library system. Brocade is a fully integrated and web-based system, developed by the University of Antwerp since 1998. The catalog of the Anet network contains approximately 2,500,000 records.

Anet sponsors complementary software incuding MLua to access Lua from a Mumps/YDB database, and lua-yottadb to access a Mumps/YDB database from Lua. Here are the official repositories of that software.
